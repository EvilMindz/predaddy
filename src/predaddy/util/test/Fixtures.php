/**
 * Utility class which makes easier to test aggregates. Supports both ES and non-ES aggregates.
 * Follows BDD concept:
 *  - init commands or events initialize the AR
 *  - the required command should be sent
 *  - the expected events, return values, or thrown exception can be checked
 *
 * {@link Fixture} helps to fill commands with aggregate ID, and ignore some properties when compares events.
 * It is convenience if the aggregate ID is generated inside the AR, and further commands need to know it.
 * This feature works only with {@link AbstractCommand} and {@link AbstractDomainEvent} objects.
 *
 * @beta This, and all related test utility classes are under development and can be modified anytime.
